This project is about developing a database for a recruitment agency. It is designed to assist the agency in managing candidate information, job vacancies, client details, and the application process. The project can be helpful for the recruitment agency itself, as it provides a centralized system to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and make informed decisions based on data analytics.
